# Week 4 Homework - Code Quiz

## Description

This website was created as a homework assignment for the University of Richmond coding boot camp. The task was to create a timed quiz application with a score-saving function. While working on this assignment, I learned about web APIs and dynamically updating the HTML and CSS of a site with JavaScript.

Incorrect answers will deduct five seconds from the clock. At the end of the quiz, you will be given the option to save your score and initials locally.
